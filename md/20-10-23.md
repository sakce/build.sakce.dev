# Off we go!

Not much has happened, but there is finally movement! Stoked to get this going - the `sakce.dev` domain is ready. I've got big plans for the whole thing 👀

Current intention for `sakce.dev` is to host various streams of what I do day to day. Starting with `read.sakce.dev` and `build.sakce.dev` that will be `Read In-/Build In Public` type things. Mostly for tracking progress and sharing (hopefully) interesting pieces. Initially, these two will be _"blogs"_, but then the data/cloud engineering side will come into play, and they will all interact with each other. Maybe.

While I figure out the format that these will take, here are some of the calls I've already made, as well as early thoughts and ideas:

- Cloudflare for hosting the sites. Triggered by the Google (Cloud) Domains being moved over to Squarespace 🤦🏻‍♂️, I wanted to get my existing `sakce.app` domain migrated. Also got intrigued by Cloudflare's approach and the possibilty of using its cloud services rather than the usual suspects. I do want to see the alleged cost savings in action. 
- I did consider static site generator frameworks for `read.sakce.dev`, but I do want more flexiblity than that. Oh, and it's just not as fun as learning a new language. So instead - thinking of a proper, hand-rolled, web app.
