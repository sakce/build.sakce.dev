What would a good structure of these `bip`'s look like?

Maybe a better question is "What is the purpose of these `bip`s?", but I might answer that some other time..

- make a note of interesting ideas that popped up while building
- raise questions around the current building that's taking place - should I rethink something? I imagine
    this will be interesting to come back to and see how often I've listened to the hunch that I can do
    something differently.
