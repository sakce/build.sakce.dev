Quite exciting. I'm going through the motions of the tutorials, but all I wanna
do is break free from it and start implementing a bunch of interesting stuff.
For example:
- I'm toying with the idea of a super simple way to automate updating the content as
    soon as I read something -- device-agnostic. A tiny serverless app... hm
    sounds like I'll need a CMS. Unless I actually host content in a bucket
    someplace? Interesting how I'm fitting my data engineering experience into web :joy:
- Scrolled through available Gatsby plugins, I'm already thinking of either using
    Mixpanel, or starting a Rudderstack plugin xD
- Do I keep these sites separate and build reusable components that I can then import;
    or do I put them all together into one repo/site. How are domains handled if it's
    one site -- I want to keep `build.sakce.dev`, `read.sakce.dev`, ... and not have
    `sakce.dev/build`, `sakce.dev/read`.
- An embedded Streamlit app showing analytics of site tracking?
- Oh shite... cookie consent :))
